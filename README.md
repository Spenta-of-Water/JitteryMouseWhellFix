# JitteryMouseWheelFix
This autohotkey script fixes jittery mouse wheel. I recommend cleaning your wheel first. If cleaning doesn't fix it, then you can use this.

This locks mouse wheel to do only wheel-up or wheel-down action for 0.2 seconds after it has been last used, this means it cannot jitter even if you want it to. 

Known issue : If your mouse registers wrong input the first time you do an action, it will only do the wrong action untill you let go of the wheel for 0.2 seconds. (this isn't a big issue for my mouse, only happens about once in 20 uses.)
